# KeyScout — AI-Powered Keyword Intelligence Crawler

## Project Overview

KeyScout is an AI-assisted search and analysis tool designed to scrape the internet for domain-specific keywords, phrases, and technology stacks.
Its goal is to help professionals, researchers, and job applicants uncover the most commonly used terminology within a given field or company.

For example, KeyScout can identify the most frequent terms used in job descriptions, research papers, or engineering blogs related to NVIDIA, Google, or other organizations.
It acts as a focused search engine and language analysis system for specific topics.

---

## Core Idea

Users provide:

* A topic or company name (e.g., “NVIDIA machine learning engineer”)
* Optional filters such as date range, websites, or language

KeyScout then:

1. Crawls the web to collect relevant pages
2. Extracts and cleans the text content
3. Analyzes word frequencies and linguistic patterns
4. Identifies domain-specific keywords, tools, and technologies
5. Returns a ranked keyword bank with example sentences
6. (Later) Allows natural-language queries and AI-powered summaries

## Features and Roadmap

| Phase                         | Description                              | Example Outcome                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Web Scraping               | Gather text data from relevant pages     | Collect job listings or articles from target sites     |
| 2. Text Cleaning & Processing | Remove noise and prepare data            | Clean text ready for keyword extraction                |
| 3. Keyword Extraction         | Identify key terms and phrases           | Output list of “CUDA,” “TensorRT,” “PyTorch,” etc.     |
| 4. Search Engine Indexing     | Enable querying stored data              | Search results for any topic or company                |
| 5. AI Integration             | Summarize or explain patterns using LLMs | “Summarize what makes NVIDIA’s ML terminology unique.” |
| 6. Web Interface / API        | Build a user-facing interface            | Streamlit app or FastAPI backend                       |

## Tech Stack (Subject to Change)

**Language:** Python
**Backend:** FastAPI or Flask
**Frontend (optional):** Streamlit or React
**Web Scraping:** Requests, BeautifulSoup, Trafilatura, Scrapy
**NLP & Analysis:** Scikit-learn (TF-IDF), SpaCy, NLTK, KeyBERT, Pandas
**Database:** SQLite (initial) or PostgreSQL (later)
**Search / Vector Index:** FAISS or Qdrant
**AI Integration (optional):** OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers
**Deployment:** Docker, Render, Railway, or AWS

---

## Example Use Case

A student applying to NVIDIA wants to align their resume language with industry terminology.

**Input:** “NVIDIA Machine Learning Engineer”
**Output:**

* Top 50 most common words (CUDA, TensorRT, PyTorch, C++)
* Top tech stacks (TensorFlow, Kubernetes, Triton, C++)
* Common phrases (“optimize CUDA kernels,” “deploy models on GPU clusters”)
* Summary: “NVIDIA emphasizes GPU optimization, inference performance, and distributed training.”

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run the crawler
python ingest/scraper.py "NVIDIA machine learning"

# 2. Process and extract keywords
python analyze/extract_keywords.py data/raw_pages/

# 3. View results in CSV or UI
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

## Future Enhancements

* Real-time semantic search using embeddings
* Resume analyzer that compares user language to industry norms
* Cross-company keyword comparison
* LLM summarization with citation support
* Interactive web dashboard and trend visualizations

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

* KeyScout will follow robots.txt and site terms of service.
* No scraping of login-protected or private pages.
* Only publicly available text is analyzed.
* Future releases will include PII filtering and domain allowlists.
